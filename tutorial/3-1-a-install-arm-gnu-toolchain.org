* Install =ARM GNU Toolchain=

** Install via package manager:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # MacOS x86
  brew install armmbed/formulae/arm-none-eabi-gcc

  # Arch Linux
  doas pacman --sync --refresh arm-none-eabi-gcc arm-none-eabi-newlib
#+END_SRC


*** MacOS M1/M2

For MacOS M1/M2, you might see the following error:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  arm-none-eabi-gcc: fatal error: cannot read spec file 'nosys.specs': No such file or directory
#+END_SRC

That's because you installed the wrong =ARM gcc=, here is how you fix that:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Remove the old one if exists
  brew uninstall arm-none-eabi-gcc
  brew autoremove 

  # Install the correct one
  brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded 
#+END_SRC
